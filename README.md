### User will push buttons onscreen to begin study session, flip cards to the back to display answers, change to next card, and tally whether they got the cards correct or incorrect. ###

### My Bronze (MVP) is a working study aid to help the user by having a keyword on the front of the card and the definition on the back of the card. The user will be able to tally how many cards they got correct and incorrect. Once they have all correct, the session will be over ###

### This was accomplished through an array of question/answer objects written in JQuery. Event listeners were placed on the buttons to accomplish the requested action and functions to fulfill those actions. When a user presses the Begin button, the game begins. When the user flips the card, if they know rthe answer -- they press the correct button and the card is taken out of the array and the correct number is tallied. If the user presses incorrect, the number is also tallied and the card remains in the array. ###
